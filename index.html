    <h2>What is the American Indian Movement?</h2>
    <p>The American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded in 1968 to address the issues of Native American rights, such as the sovereignty of tribal nations, treaty rights, and justice for Native people. AIM‚Äîthe American Indian Movement‚Äîbegan in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the summer of 1968. It began taking form when 200 people from the Indian community turned out for a meeting called by a group of Native American community activists led by George Mitchell, Dennis Banks, and Clyde Bellecourt. Frustrated by discrimination and decades of federal Indian policy, they came together to discuss the critical issues restraining them and to take control over their own destiny. Out of that ferment and determination, the American Indian Movement was born.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the 20th century, the federal government imposed a higher degree of control over Indian lands, with the intention of breaking up tribes and assimilating their members into American cities. ‚ÄúTermination policy‚Äù became federal law in 1953, as Congress formally ended its recognition of more than 100 tribes, encouraging Indians to leave reservations for the cities of the West and Midwest. A significant number of people moved from reservations to the cities, where they encountered a lack of educational opportunities and racial profiling at the hands of the police.

      Dennis Banks and Clyde Bellecourt, two Ojibwa men who had met in prison, founded AIM in 1968 in Minneapolis, along with Bellecourt's brother Vernon and Banks' friend George Mitchell. AIM's original goal was to curb racial profiling in Minneapolis and give a voice to Native Americans living in the city.
      
      One of AIM's first actions was to create the AIM Patrol, which monitored how police and the courts treated Native Americans. AIM also supported the creation of the Indian Health Board of Minneapolis to provide healthcare to the Native community. Its leaders took inspiration from the civil rights movement and the policies of nonviolent confrontation that many of its leaders espoused, although as the years went on AIM members would occasionally take up arms.</p>

      <h2>Occupations and Education</h2> 
      <p>Occupations and Education
      AIM's early protests against police brutality earned the new organization notoriety, and its membership grew rapidly. Banks and other AIM members were a part of the coalition occupied Alcatraz Island in 1969, asserting Indigenous authority over the island in an ironic imitation of Europeans‚Äô takeover of the continent.
      
      Other early AIM actions mirrored the Alcatraz occupation. On Thanksgiving 1970, AIM members seized a replica of the Mayflower in Boston Harbor, declaring a national day of mourning. The following year saw one of the most iconic protests in Native American history‚Äîthe occupation of Mt. Rushmore. For two months, activists camped on the mountain, a sacred site to local tribes which had been turned into a monument to American presidents, demanding federal recognition of the Treaty of Fort Laramie, which had granted the area to the Lakota tribe but was broken as soon as gold was discovered nearby.
      
      Other occupations succeeded in winning material gains for local Natives. AIM played a role in the takeover of the Winter Dam in Wisconsin after it cause the flooding of Lac Court Oreilles Ojibwa land. The standoff ended with a settlement that returned 25,000 acres to the tribe. In 1971, 30 militants led by Herb Powless, founder of AIM‚Äôs Milwaukee chapter, took over an abandoned Coast Guard station on the city‚Äôs lakefront, citing a treaty from the previous century and claiming the land ‚Äúfor the good and welfare of the Indian people.‚Äù
      
      The occupiers were armed, but encountered no resistance, so they relocated an alcohol treatment program and the fledgling Indian Community School into the abandoned building. Eventually, the government recognized the Native Americans‚Äô right to the land, where the school operated for several years before moving to a new location. In 1972, the year after the occupation of the Milwaukee Coast Guard building, AIM founded the Heart of the Earth Survival School in Minneapolis, a K-12 school designed as an alternative to schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. </p>

      <p>The Trail of Broken Treaties, Recognition and Blowback
        A consistent tactic of AIM organizers has been to draw attention to the federal government's long history of broken promises to Indigenous Americans. In 1972, AIM organized its most ambitious action to date, the Trail of Broken Treaties. Hundreds of Native Americans drove in caravans, beginning on the West Coast, to the offices of the Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C. During the occupation, AIM released the Twenty Points, a list of demands that included the re-recognition of Native tribes, abolition of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (an organ of the Department of the Interior) and federal protections for Indigenous cultures and religions. The occupiers held the BIA office for a week, building a tipi on its lawn.
        
        President Richard Nixon dismissed the Twenty Points but took the protest seriously, endorsing self-determination for Indian tribes. With his support, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, which reversed the termination policy and provided recognition and funds to Indian tribes.
        
        Between the Trail of Broken Treaties and the passage of the Self-Determination Act, however, violent conflict erupted between Native American activists and federal authorities. In 1973, an Indian man named Wesley Bad Heart Bull was stabbed to death by a white man in Custer, South Dakota. AIM activists and others rallied to the area to demand justice, but were not satisfied with the local authorities response. The confrontation escalated into a riot in Custer followed by an armed Indian occupation of the Pine Ridge Reservation, the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre.

        Several AIM members stand next to a sweat lodge erected on a hill below the Sacred Heart Church during the occupation of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota, 1973.
        For 71 days, as federal marshals and the FBI cordoned off the area and refused to allow the press inside. In sporadic exchanges of gunfire, two Indian activists were killed and another 14 wounded, with two FBI agents killed and two wounded. Ray Robinson, an African American civil rights activist, disappeared while occupying Wounded Knee, and is believed to have been murdered. Banks was arrested, along with prominent AIM member Russell Means, although the charges against them were later thrown out.
        
        The Washington protests and the violence at Pine Ridge drew attention to AIM's cause. Later that year, actor Marlon Brando sent Sacheen Littlefeather, a woman who had participated in the occupation of Alcatraz and who claimed Native American ancestry, to accept the Academy Award for Best Actor on his behalf. In 1974, AIM called for a gathering of Indigenous people from across the Western Hemisphere on the land of the Standing Rock Sioux in South Dakota. More than 5,000 representatives from 98 Indigenous nations attended, forming the International Indian Treaty Council. Later that year, the IITC received official recognition from the UN, the first Indigenous organization to do so.
        
        In 1975, the Department of Housing and Urban Development designated AIM as the primary sponsor of Little Earth of United Tribes, the first Indigenous housing project in the country, in Minneapolis. In 1978, AIM organized a second march from the West Coast to Washington, titled the "Longest Walk." President Jimmy Carter refused to meet with the protestors, but the action received support from Sen. Robert Kennedy and cultural figures like Brando and boxer Muhammad Ali. Their arrival coincided with the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, which granted Native Americans the right to use certain lands and controlled substances for religious ceremonies. </p>

    <p> Fighting for Culture and International Indigenous Rights
      The late 1970s and '80s were marked by infighting within AIM, as the revelation that the organization's head of security was an FBI informant sowed seeds of distrust. In recent decades, AIM has been known primarily for cultural advocacy and for its work on behalf of Indigenous rights on a global scale.
      
      In 1991, Clyde Bellecourt and others revived the Sundance, a traditional gathering of celebration and thanksgiving, at Pipestone National Monument. The ceremony has been held every year since. Clyde's brother Vernon became active in the fight to rename American sports teams, convincing the NCAA to bar the use of Indian mascots during its tournaments in 2005. None of Bellecourts ‚Äúbig four‚Äù targets had changed their names before his death in 2007, but two of them‚Äînow known as the Cleveland Guardians and the Washington Commanders‚Äîeventually relented.
      
      In 2007, the UN adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, enshrining the rights of Indigenous peoples to cultural and ceremonial expression, identity, language, employment, health and education into international law by a vote of 144 to 4 (the United States and Canada both voted ‚Äúno‚Äù). The declaration was a watershed moment for the international Indigenous community which AIM had helped unite.
      
      Despite these victories, AIM itself split in 1993, with one successor organization based in Minneapolis and another based in Denver. In 2008, the Heart of the Earth Survival School closed as its Executive Director was investigated for fraud, but over its 36-year history, the school graduated more Native students than the rest of the Minneapolis public school system put together.
      
      Often overshadowed by other, larger movements and by the infighting that led to its rupture, AIM was nevertheless an active and highly effective element of the broader push for civil rights in the 1960s and '70s. Its early radical actions and repeated occupations of government buildings succeeded in extracting concessions, including the passage of laws that dramatically altered federal policy toward Native Americans. </p>

 <section class="The Longest Walk, 1978">
    <h>The Longest Walk, 1978</h>
   <div class="The Longest Walk, 1978">
      <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Fighting for Our Survival‚Äù
On February 11, 1978, more than 300 Native Americans gathered on Alcatraz Island. A peace pipe was passed among the crowd, while a medicine man spoke and others beat drums. The ceremony marked the beginning of a five-month pilgrimage of Native American activists to Washington, D.C., the fourth in ten years. In a demonstration they called the Longest Walk, twenty-four Indians planned to walk the entire distance from California to the nation‚Äôs capital, to be joined by supporters along the way and at their destination. Once in D.C., they would engage in eight days of demonstrations, protests, religious ceremonies, and educational workshops.

The Longest Walk was conceived as both a spiritual and political demonstration. Adding to the general call for sovereignty behind the previous demonstrations, the Longest Walk protested eleven pieces of legislation then being considered by Congress that would violate various treaty rights, particularly concerning Indian land, fishing, and mineral rights. The demonstrations were also an opportunity to educate non-Indians about Indian cultural and spiritual life.

Drawing on the traditions and movements of the past, the Longest Walk pointed toward the future and a new era in Native American struggles for survival.

The Evolving Struggle for Native American Rights
By 1978, the pilgrimage to the nation‚Äôs capital had become a well-established format for Native activists seeking change to federal Indian policy. But the Longest Walk marked a clear evolution in struggle for Native American rights. Much had changed in the decade since American Indian activists had joined the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign in 1968. Years of activism had brought an end to the destructive federal policy of termination, and some measures had even been taken to begin to reverse the damages done in the past.

The movement itself had also evolved. During the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign, activists had struggled to distinguish their struggle for sovereignty from the Civil Rights struggle with which the American public was more familiar. By 1978, American Indian activists had developed a clear and effective message, which both clarified the issue of sovereignty for the American public and mobilized Native Americans across the country. That message identified colonialism as the problem and sovereignty as the solution. With this more sophisticated understanding of Native struggles, moreover, Native activists in the United States increasingly saw themselves engaged in a common struggle with colonized people the world over and began working toward a hemispheric movement of indigenous peoples. In 1974, AIM called for the formation of the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC), an organization of Indigenous peoples from North, Central, and South America. The year before the Longest Walk, the United Nations recognized the IITC, giving Indigenous peoples a voice on the world stage.[1]

But for all that had changed in the previous decade, much had remained the same. As Native American activists gained strength in their calls for recognition of their treaty rights over the previous ten years, they summoned a backlash from many state governments and private interests who proposed laws to develop the land and resources belonging to Indian communities. One such law was the Native American Equal Opportunity Act, a law that, if passed, would revoke all treaties entered into between the United States and any Indian tribe.[2] Other proposed bills would allow for the extraction of oil and mineral resources from Native lands and strip Native nations of the hunting, fishing, land, and water rights for which they had fought so hard.

The Road to Washington
After the opening ceremony on Alcatraz Island, the demonstrators officially embarked from Sacramento. At a rally across the street from the state Capitol, march organizer Dennis Banks told a crowd of several hundred, ‚ÄúWe are forced to walk for survival.‚Äù[3] Banks, who had helped to found the American Indian Movement in 1968, had also been instrumental in organizing the 1972 Trail of Broken Treaties.

The Longest Walk proceeded with little fanfare until it reached Minneapolis, Minnesota. There the marchers constructed a sweat lodge and conducted traditional religious ceremonies at Fort Snelling State Park. They were joined students from the Heart of the Earth Survival School‚Äîa school founded by AIM in 1972. The students joined the marchers in a ‚ÄúRun for Survival,‚Äù running the 560 miles to Lawrence, Kansas in shifts with cars following beside them. Clyde Bellecourt, another veteran of the Trail of Broken Treaties, began contacting tribal councils along the march route, and soon supporters began joining in large numbers, joining in ceremonies and workshops to learn of the impending legislation. The also addressed the legislatures of the states they passed through. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd go into the halls of government with a drum and sing our ceremonial songs and the AIM national anthem,‚Äù Bellecourt recalled years later. ‚ÄúThen we‚Äôd make a presentation, stressing the importance of the Indian Religious Freedom Act, a bill that was moving through Congress at the time that would legalize Native American spiritual practices. We also asked for their support in killing congressional action that would abrogate our treaties.‚Äù[4]

‚ÄúWelcome to Indian Country!‚Äù[5]
On July 15, 1978, the Longest Walk arrived in Washington, D.C. The original group of 24 was accompanied by some 2,000 supporters as they marched into the city. Their solemn march through the capital was accompanied by the beat of a drum. Surrounded by police and security guards, the demonstration proceeded down Georgia and Arkansas avenues, then 16th Street NW to Meridian Hill Malcolm X Park, where they rallied to a group of Black, white, and Indian supporters, now numbering 3,000. ‚ÄúWelcome to Indian country!‚Äù shouted Longest Walk organizer Bill Means to the assembled crowd.

Joining the demonstrators were comedian Dick Gregory and actor Marlon Brando, both long-time supporters of Indian sovereignty. Clyde Bellecourt reminded everyone present what was at stake: ‚ÄúThe multinational corporations want our land,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey want uranium, coal, lignite that‚Äôs under our land‚Ä¶The theft that took place 150 years ago of our farmlands and timber is no different from today.‚Äù[6]

An estimated 2,800 participants camped at Greenbelt Park in Prince George‚Äôs County, roughly twelve miles from downtown Washington. Over the following week, they would come into the city each day, holding rallies, marches, and religious ceremonies. They demonstrated before Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, and the FBI building on the legislation in Congress. Meanwhile, a group of 200 to 300 religious leaders maintained a four-day vigil at a separate spiritual camp in West Potomac Park near the Lincoln Memorial, the former site of Resurrection City. Marked by tipis on the National Mall, the vigil site cut a striking image on America‚Äôs most iconic landscape.

The week of demonstrations concluded with a powwow on the Ellipse behind the White House on July 22, marking a vibrant end to the peaceful demonstration. Though they had faced a cold reception from Congress and the administration, many were encouraged by the experience. ‚ÄúI feel that we have reached and educated millions of people. That was what the walk was about. It was a tremendous success.‚Äù[7]

As if to emphasize that success, Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act just days after their arrival, followed a few months later by the Indian Child Welfare Act, both critical laws in protecting Native American rights and freedoms. And of the eleven pieces of legislation that the demonstrators had come to protest, not one would be passed.

A Tale of Two Marches
There was a striking contrast between the Longest Walk and the Trail of Broken Treaties in 1972, particularly in the government‚Äôs response to the demonstrators. In the earlier demonstration, the government had closed ranks against the marchers and refused to meet with them. The situation escalated until the occupation of BIA.

By contrast, in the Longest Walk, the government welcomed the demonstrators with open arms. The National Park Service cleared the way for the large encampment on Greenbelt Park and rapidly approved the vigil site in West Potomac Park. The National Guard provided logistical assistance, setting up a mess tent to feed the demonstrators in Greenbelt Park and installing portable showers and toilets. The Guard also set up army tents and a portable clinic to house and care for the marchers.[8

]How to account for the different response? A lot of it had to do with the work that AIM and other Native American activists had been doing across the country in raising awareness and working to address the problems in Indian communities across the country. Six years after the Trail of Broken Treaties, Native Americans marched into a different Washington, one that was ready to begin to acknowledge the wrongs of the past.

That work continues today.
